    <h3><u>Biography</u></h3>
    <div class="p-div">
      <p>
        Hi, I'm Onyinye Ibiam, a first semester student in the School of Engineering at AltSchool Africa pursuing a diploma in Cloud Engineering. I'm switching careeers from Microbiology to Tech. Microbes are cool, so are packet data - maybe even cooler. <br><br> Ever since I can remember, I've always had a particular fascination about technology, especially in the domain of computers. Currently, I'm learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript - I call them "The Three Muskerteers." I'd like to say I'm passionate about learning to code, but lately coding seems to be passionate about me - IYKYK. We're just gonna hang in there.<br><br> Outside of anything related to tech, I enjoy music (classical, Trance, rock...), documentaries (nature, history, science...), and looking at all sorts of clouds in the sky (when I get the chance) - I don't think people look at clouds as much as they need to.

    <h3><u>Why I Joined Alt School</u></h3>
    <div class="p-div">
      <p>
        Well, first of all, I just want to say I didn't join AltSchool Africa because of what Falz the Bahd Guy said in the video ad. Just wanna put it out there, so you know ;). If you're curious, you can watch the video over <a href="https://youtu.be/k2lrwK-N02o?si=7fPKiTSbEFMZOLTB" class="falz">here</a>. <br><br> Anyways, why did I join AltSchool Africa? I joined AltSchool Africa because I saw it as the opportunity I needed to help me switch my career path. The tech world is incredibly vast - to the point that it literally stupefies you. Knowing how to navigate it and take the right turns is crucial in ensuring you don't end up in weird place. <br><br> As an individual, you can change careers on your own. But when there's the opportunity to do so, coupled with the help and guidance, you should take that opportunity. I believe that's what AltSchool Africa offers. Plus, there's strength in numbers. I get to meet other cool people on the same journey as I am. It doesn't any better than that. The only way is up!

    <h3><u>My Goal for School of Engineering Programme</u></h3>
    <div class="p-div">
      <p>My goal is pretty simple and straight-forward. I aim to make the best out of this opportunity to learn the skills, mindset, and disposition required to succeed in Cloud Engineering and the tech industry in general. <br><br> I might revisit this goal as some point in the future, but for now it is what I'm working with.</p>
